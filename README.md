## üß∞ Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tkcalendar pandas plyer
```

> üìù Note: `tkinter` usually comes pre-installed with Python on Windows.  
> If not, install it via your system‚Äôs package manager.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- The **`main.py`** file launches the graphical interface.  
- You can:
  - Add reminders with a date, time, and message.
  - View all reminders in a table.
  - Delete selected reminders.
- When you start the main app, it automatically starts the **`service.py`** script in the background.  
- The **`service.py`** file checks every **30 seconds** for reminders whose time has passed and shows a desktop notification.

---

## üß≠ Usage Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the App
Run the GUI app:
```bash
python main.py
```

When you open it:
- You‚Äôll see a table with all saved reminders.
- Use **‚ÄúAdd Reminder‚Äù** to add a new one.
- The **‚ÄúDelete Reminders‚Äù** button removes selected entries.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a Reminder
- Choose a **date** using the calendar picker.
- Set the **time (hours, minutes, AM/PM)**.
- Enter a **message**.
- Click **Add Reminder**.

Your reminder will be saved in `reminders.csv`.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Notification Service
You don‚Äôt need to run anything separately ‚Äî  
`main.py` automatically launches `service.py` silently in the background.

`service.py`:
- Runs every 30 seconds.
- Checks if any reminders are due.
- Displays a system notification.
- Updates the reminder status from `Pending` ‚Üí `Completed`.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage
All reminders are stored in a CSV file:
```
reminders.csv
```

Columns:
| Message | Reminder Time | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Good Morning | 2025-10-28 07:00:00 | Pending |

---

## ü™Ñ Converting to EXE (Optional)

You can convert your app to an `.exe` file using **PyInstaller**:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then build:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --add-data "reminders.csv;." --add-data "service.py;." main.py
```

Your EXE will be inside the `dist` folder.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure `service.py` and `reminders.csv` are in the same directory as `main.py` before building.

---

## üß© Troubleshooting

**‚ùå SyntaxError: invalid syntax (line with `service_process is_`)**
- Ensure the line in `main.py` reads:
  ```python
  if service_process is None:
  ```
  (not `is_`)

**‚ùå Notification not appearing**
- Check that `plyer` is installed properly.
- Some systems may require enabling notification permissions.

**‚ùå CSV not found**
- The file `reminders.csv` will be auto-created the first time you run the app.

## üí° Future Improvements
- Add sound/vocal notifications  
- Support recurring reminders  
- System tray icon with background running option  
- Dark mode UI
